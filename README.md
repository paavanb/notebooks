# notebooks

I've found Jupyter Notebooks to be effective for teaching, letting you interact with the audience and experiment with code in real time. In this repo you'll find notebooks that I've created over the years for myself and for others to learn from.  
  
If you just want to view the notebooks, you can [use nbviewer on this repository here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pbhavsar/notebooks/tree/master/)

If you want to run the notebooks yourself, you should [install Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html).
For javascript notebooks, you'll need to [install the iJavascript kernel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ijavascript), using node v7.6.0.
Then, run with `ijs --ijs-spec-path=full`.
